# The-Rick-and-Morty-ReactJS
This project includes the characters and features of the Rick and Morty series. <br>
Project Link: the-rick-and-morty-series.netlify.app <br>
This is the API service I use: https://rickandmortyapi.com/

This assignment was built with React JS. My goal was to create a website using data from a public API service.

# Details :
- Find details about the series and API on the main page, and you can search with the character name you want. <br/>
- View the characters of the series on the characters page <br />
- Access character information by clicking on each character. <br/>
# I used these technologies :
- React <br/>
- React Router Dom <br>
- Bootstrap 5 <br>
- Public API <br>
- Custom Pagination
